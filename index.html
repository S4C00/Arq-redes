    <p><h3>
        <br>In a strictly technical sense, the 4.5G network is an extension of 4G LTE and is an emerging technology also called License Assisted Access (LAA) that works by aggregating licensed and unlicensed LTE frequency bands.

        <p><h1><b><span style="color: blue;"><center>Past of 4.5G</center></span></b></h1></p>  
        <p><h3>
            <span style="color: blue;">1G:</span> <br>The signal is the name for the first generation of mobile technologies, which began operating in the early 1980s. Although the antennas were connected digitally to the telephone system, this network was basically analog and achieved data transfer rates of up to 10 Kb/s.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">2G:</span> <br>Also known as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), this protocol made it possible to standardize, and therefore make mobile connections compatible, starting in the 1990s. It made it possible to achieve transfer rates of up to 97 Kb/s and gave step to the famous short message system, better known as SMS, in addition to outlining the first cellular forays into the Internet.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">2.5G:</span> <br>Actually called General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), it was an extension of the GMS system that allowed the simultaneous transmission of data and voice, through information packets, increasing the speed up to 32 Kb/s.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">EDGE:</span> <br>Halfway between 2G and 3G technology, Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution evolved, which in Spanish means “Improved Data Rates for the evolution of GSM”, expanding transfer rates up to 480 Kb/s.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">3G:</span> <br>Implemented around 2001, it is currently the type of cellular technology with the greatest penetration in the market. It paved the way for efficient Internet browsing, the use of social networks and the first voice over IP experiences.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">3G+:</span> <br>In 2008, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) represented a technological bridge halfway between 3G and 4G technology, which allowed transfer speeds of up to 84 Mb/s.<br><br>
            <span style="color: blue;">4G:</span> <br>4G LTE (4th Generation Long Term Evolution) is the fourth generation of mobile telephone technologies, which is the evolution of 2G (GSM/EDGE) and 3G (UMTS/HSPA/HSDPA) technologies, which were developed by the 3GPP organization. (3rd Generation Partnership Project), to allow users more quality and faster service. LTE is based on the IP protocol, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6, the main difference with 3G technology can be seen in the following aspects:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            1) use of OFDM technology.<br>
2) use of the MIMO technique. <br>
3) definition of a System Architecture Evolution (SAE).
        </ol></h3>
        <p><h3>
            Where, MIMO allows for high spectral efficiency, SAE improves data capacity, reducing the latency experienced by the user, and also uses time and frequency division duplexing TDD and FDD respectively, which improves the use of the spectrum. making its management more efficient, including unicast and broadcast services; and finally the use of channel coding provides security and reduces the probability of error in transmission. In 2004, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a collaboration between telecommunications standards organizations, began developing LTE as a new air interface and radio access network architecture to meet the changing requirements of mobile communications. <br><br>
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has begun outlining requirements for 4G technology, focusing on achieving higher data speeds, lower latency and improved spectral efficiency. LTE development focused on improving data speed, reducing latency, and increasing spectral efficiency.
In 2012, the first version of LTE was launched, offering download speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s. As the technology evolved, more advanced versions were developed, such as LTE Advanced, reaching speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s.<br><br>
Emerged a decade ago and is based on a completely data platform, which simplifies the network architecture. The main qualities of 4G LTE connectivity (acronym for Fourth Generation Long-Term Evolution) are higher upload and download speeds, reaching up to 150 Mbps (10 times the speed of 3G) on mobile devices, along with lower “lags” ( delay) in data transmission, compared to previous generations.<br><br>
LTE allows a theoretical download speed of 300 Mbit/s; The evolution of this technology, known as LTE Advanced, will present the necessary characteristics to be called 4G, offering theoretical speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s for users in a fixed location and 100 Mbit/s for mobile users.<br><br>
<span style="color: blue;">LTE PRO (4.5G): :</span><br>Also known as 4G LTE Advanced, LTE-A or 4.5G, it is currently the highest point of mobile internet connection available in the world. Unlike traditional data connections, the LTE PRO network uses multiple antennas and advanced data transmission schemes. This new technology, incorporated into the Avantel network, has the potential to offer speeds of up to 286 Mbps. This mobile communication standard allows 4G voice calls to be made, a high definition technology supported by VoLTE technology, thereby increasing the sound quality, connection time between calls is reduced, allows browsing at the same time in 4G and improves battery life.

        <p><h1><b><span style="color: blue;"><center>Modulations</center></span></b></h1></p>  
        <p><h3>
            Modulations in 4.5G allow for optimized data transmission at higher speeds and in high-density device environments. The main types of modulation are:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            •<span style="color: blue;">QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying):</span><br> Primarily used for signals with low signal-to-noise conditions. QPSK is a robust modulation but has lower spectral efficiency compared to more complex modulations.<br><br>
•	<span style="color: blue;">16-QAM (16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):</span><br>This modulation allows more bits to be sent per symbol compared to QPSK, making it more efficient under better signal-to-noise conditions. 16-QAM can transmit 4 bits per symbol.<br><br>
•	<span style="color: blue;">64-QAM (64-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation): </span><br>Allows for even more data transmission by including 6 bits per symbol. This modulation is used in environments with a high signal-to-noise ratio, as it is more susceptible to noise.<br><br>
•	<span style="color: blue;">256-QAM (256-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation): </span><br>The most advanced modulation used in 4.5G. It transmits 8 bits per symbol and is highly spectrally efficient, but it is also very sensitive to interference, making it optimal for ideal signal conditions.<br><br>
    </ol></h3>

    <b><h3><span style="color: blue;">Transmission and Network Optimization Techniques in 4.5G</span></h3></b>
    <h3><ol>
        •	<span style="color: blue;">Carrier Aggregation (CA):</span><br>This technique combines multiple frequency blocks or "carriers" to increase transmission capacity and speed. It enables devices to connect to multiple frequency bands simultaneously, pooling the bandwidth of each to enhance user experience.<br><br>
        •	<span style="color: blue;">MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output): </span><br>Uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve network capacity and speed. In 4.5G, advanced configurations like 4x4 MIMO are implemented, allowing transmission capacity to multiply and enabling simultaneous data reception, which enhances performance in high-density user areas.<br><br>
        •	<span style="color: blue;">CoMP (Coordinated MultiPoint): </span><br>Allows multiple base stations to work together to transmit and receive data to a device, improving coverage and speed in areas with weak coverage.<br><br>        
</ol></h3>
<br><br>
            <p><h1><b><span style="color: blue;"><center>Multiplexing</center></span></b></h1></p>  
            <p><h3>
                This new radio architecture is characterized by high spectral efficiency through the use of two different multiplexing schemes:
            </h3></p>
            <h3><ol>
                •	OFDMA. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. It is used in the downlink. 
        </ol></h3></p>
        <p><h3>
            Subcarriers are assigned to each user, by means of orthogonal codes, according to the users' requirements. This method achieves strong noise immunity while allowing many frequency assignment criteria to be defined (type of service, quality of connection, tariff, etc.).<br><br>
The subcarriers are modulated with a range of QPSK, 16QAM and 16QAM symbols.
        </h3></p>
        <b><h3><span style="color: blue;"><center>Subcarrier representation in 5Mhz bandwidth in OFDMA to standardize LTE.</center></span></h3></b>
        <center><img src="ofdma.png" width="700" heigth="700"></H5></center></p>
        <h3><ol>
            •	SC-FDMA. Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access. Although OFDMA multiplexing has advantages for the downstream channel, it is not suitable for the characteristics of the upstream channel, where the transmitter does not have the linear power required to maintain stable multiplexing symbols. Therefore, another technique is chosen to avoid triggering the device's battery consumption. The transmission process of the SC-FDMA scheme is very similar to that of OFDMA. In fact, it can be considered as a precoded version, using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), of OFDMA. 
    </ol></h3>
    <p><h3>
        The following figure shows a sequence of eight QPSK symbols in an example with 4 subcarriers. For OFDMA, the 4 symbols are taken in parallel, each modulating its own sub-carrier in the appropriate QPSK phase. After an OFDMA symbol period, some time is left (so that there is no overlap) before the next symbol period. In SC-FDMA, each symbol is transmitted sequentially. Thus, all 4 symbols are transmitted in the same time period. The highest symbol range requires four times the spectrum bandwidth. After four symbols the time is left to avoid overlaps mentioned above.
    </h3></p>

    <center><img src="ofdma1.png" width="700" heigth="700"></H5></center></p>
    <p><h3>
        In relation to the spectrum, LTE allows an adaptive bandwidth: 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz. As it could not be otherwise, to reach the speeds promised in the standard it is necessary to reach the previous maximum of 20Mhz, something that is not always possible for operators due to the limitations of the radio spectrum.
    </h3></p><br>

        <p><h1><b><span style="color: blue;"><center>Radio spectrum (bandwidths)</center></span></b></h1></p><b></h1></p>
        <p><h3>
            The frequency or band in which communications links operate is between 3 Hz and 300 GHz, called the radio spectrum.

        <h3>
            The 4.5 LTE-A technology or network operates in frequencies from 450 MHz to 2600 MHz (Bands 7 and 8) and has a bandwidth of 20 MHz (Train for employment, n.d.)<br><br>
In a strictly technical sense, the 4.5G network is an extension of 4G LTE and is an emerging technology also called License Assisted Access (LAA) that works by aggregating licensed and unlicensed LTE frequency bands (LTE-U in the 2.4 and 5 GHz spectrum). The use of these unlicensed spectrums allows antennas to allow an increase in connected devices from one thousand to one hundred thousand per antenna, this will alleviate network congestion and allow mobile devices to have greater bandwidth and therefore be faster and more agile.<br><br>
For the Internet of Things, 4.5G networks operate under the parameters of LTE-M and LTE-U which are designed for machine-to-machine communication channels and also for the microcommunications required by sensors and IoT devices to “talk” to each other and to their central administrator.

        <p><h1><b><span style="color: blue;"><center>Protocols</center></span></b></h1></p>
        <p><h2><b><span style="color: blue;">4.5G Network Standards</span></b></h2></p>
        <p><h3>
            The 4.5G mobile generation is based on the standards used for 4G, which have been adapted to offer low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). These standards include:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            • <span style="color: blue;">Cat-0:</span><br> 20 MHz bandwidth, data rate of up to 1 Mbps and a Half-Duplex channel<br><br>
• <span style="color: blue;">Cat-M1/Cat-M/LTE-M:</span><br> Uses less power consumption and cost than Cat-0 and is more compatible with LTE infrastructure, covering up to 11 km, provides a maximum rate of up to 1 Mbps on a 1.4 MHz frequency, has a Half-Duplex channel and is ideal for mobile and fixed applications.<br><br>
• <span style="color: blue;">NB-IoT/Cat-M2:</span><br>Operates outside of the LTE bands and is more expensive, eliminates the use of a Gateway, uses a narrow band of 200 KHz in uplink and downlink, has a Half-Duplex channel and is ideal for static sensor applications.
        </ol></h3></p><br>
        <p><h3>
            The previous standards are used in 4.5G and also implement improvements that 4G does not have, such as:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            • Offering a data rate greater than 1 Gbps (3 times more than 4G)<br>
• Supporting up to 100 thousand connections in a cell (100 times more than 4G)<br>
• Lower end-to-end transmission delay (10 milliseconds) (5 times more than 4G)<br>
        </ol></h3><br>
        <p><h2><b><span style="color: blue;">Access to the base radio</span></b></h2></p>
        <p><h3>
            For access to the base radio, media access technologies are used to avoid interference or interruptions between the multiple users that are connected to the network using duplex technologies that can be of two types:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            • <span style="color: blue;">Time division duplex:</span><br> Assigns a time to each cell phone and uses a single frequency in areas where traffic is not balanced and there must be synchronization between the receiver and transmitter.<br><br>
            • <span style="color: blue;">Frequency division duplex:</span><br>Uses two frequencies for each channel that transmit at the same time, which is why it presents a low efficiency in the use of the spectrum.
        </ol></h3><br>
        <p><h2><b><span style="color: blue;">Multiple access control protocols</span></b></h2></p>
        <p><h3>
            And to respond to multiple users at the same time, multiple access control techniques or protocols are used such as:
        </h3></p>
        <h3><ol>
            • <span style="color: blue;">FDMA (Frequency Division Access):</span><br> Access is based on the frequency indicated by the network<br><br>
            • <span style="color: blue;">TDMA (Time Division Access):</span><br>The network serves each user in short periods of time to make it imperceptible to the user.<br><br>
            • <span style="color: blue;">CDMA (Code Division Access): </span><br>Each user has a code to establish a connection at the same time.<br><br>
            • <span style="color: blue;">OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access: </span><br>These are subcarriers with a smaller separation than FDMA that corresponds to each user, supporting more users. Frequency reuse establishes 7 bands arranged in hexagons that represent the coverage area of each base radio (cluster) that is repeated the number of times necessary to cover the coverage area so that there is the greatest amount of distance between base radios that operate on the same frequency.
        </ol></h3><br>
        <p><h2><b><span style="color: blue;">Security protocols</span></b></h2></p>
        <p><h3>
            Security within the 4.5G network is based on NAS/integrity encryption
        </h3></p>
        <b><h3><span style="color: blue;"><center>NAS encryption</center></span></h3></b>
        <center><img src="nas.png" width="400" heigth="400"></H5></center></p>
        <h3><ol>
            • <span style="color: blue;">NAS (Non-Access Stratum): </span><br>Securely delivers signaling messages between the user and the MME in the control plane, using control keys for encryption.<br><br>
            • <span style="color: blue;">RRC (Radio Resource Protocol): </span><br>It is a protocol that uses another protocol called PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) for encryption, integrity protection and transfer in the user and control planes. Thus, the RRC obtains the encryption keys by sending a security mode command between the user and the base radio that has integrity protection and an encryption algorithm.
